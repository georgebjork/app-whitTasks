NOTICE: The Azure database is now offline so that app will not work as intended for the time being. If you want a demo of the app, you can find it a video of it at the bottom of this README.

This is an app built for my Computer Science class, How to Build Darn Near Anything. 

UI design was created by Madeline Schiefelbein.

We decided to build this app because we feel that at Whitworth University, no app can help students easily see their day and upcoming assignments. We feel that our app, WhitTasks, is the solution. The current system, an optional Blackboard app, has a variety of challenges, such as lag when assignments are posted and a difficult to use UI. The Blackboard app is limited to only assignment postings as well. Our app will provide students with the ability to add in their school schedule, as well as activities around campus that they are interested in attending, or meetings that they have to attend. Students can add these into a checklist feature of the app that would allow them to check off each of these “tasks” as they are completed.

Our final product demonstrates the MyDay page and the Calender page. The MyDay page can create and remove tasks. It can also mark them as completed and the names of tasks can be edited. The Calender page shows tasks based on their due date. Given we only had a little less than one semester to build this app, our app did not feature everything we wanted, but nonetheless, we are very happy with how our final product turned out.
