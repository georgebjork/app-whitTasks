# app-whitTasks

This is an app built for my Computer Science class, How to Build Darn Near Anything. 

UI design was created by Madeline Schiefelbein.

We decided to build this app because we feel that at Whitworth University, no app can help students easily see their day and upcoming assignments. We feel that our app, WhitTasks, is the solution. The current system, an optional Blackboard app, has a variety of challenges, such as lag when assignments are posted and a difficult to use UI. The Blackboard app is limited to only assignment postings as well. Our app provides students with the ability to add in their school schedule, as well as activities around campus that they are interested in attending, or meetings that they have to attend. Students can add these into a checklist feature of the app that would allow them to check off each of these “tasks” as they are completed.

At the moment we have the "My Day" page built and the Calender page built. The My Day page will be the first thing students see when they open their app. This will show any upcoming assignments that have been posted to Blackboard as well as any Tasks they have added themselves. The currently added Calender page displays tasks in a calender view. The user is able to click through differnt days and see all tasks for a given day. Eventually, we will have more pages built such as a campus activities page.

Here we have a current demo and final of our app.

This video demonstrates our finished product for our app.
